# CS323
The project for CS323 at WSU. My team choose to make a game.

Team Members: David Fletcher, Jacob St.Hilaire, and myself

We implemented a 'Bullet-Hell' ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up#Bullet_hell_and_niche_appeal ) game for the semester-long project. In this version, I have striped away all code not written by me, leaving a barebones but functional game.

We coded in C# and .NET (and tested only on Window 8 and 8.1). Frameworks:
- Monogame: http://www.monogame.net/
- XNA 4.0 Game Studio Refresh (for the content project): https://mxa.codeplex.com/releases/view/117230

This project was very much a learning experience for my team, so there were a lot of choices made early that proved poor later on in development. At some point, I plan on redoing this game 'properly' though, as it was a blast programming it.
